This program should be used for gtk desktops meaning gnome or freedesktop, openbox probably...
You can change the sound theme by simply choosing files for events and then all them will be saved in /.local directory, so it is supposed to be working like that
But if not (s happens) you can move that directory into /usr/share/sounds and rename it to freedesktop then it will work more like for sure.
there's another place /usr/local/share/sounds to move on, but youshould use $home/.local/share/sounds instead.
to play sounds you will need gtk-play and actually python installed. to compile it simply use | python ./set* build | > | python ./set* install |
there's an iverride of sounds in __custom directory but it is not listed this bug is avoided because of the wrong structure of index.theme file.
so you should name your theme with 2 letters minimum and better way of using it is to save theme with pushing the @SAVE button

Many thanks to Yuichi Nishiwaki
who actually created the program and did it great, so ai just can put few strings and interfaces into it so it was working just like that. 
oh i found that you can simply click twice on gstmanager.py file in gstmanager folder and you can use the program without installing
